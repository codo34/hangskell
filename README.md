# Hangskell
### A command-line hangman game written in Haskell

Put hangman.exe into a directory and run `$ hangman` to play.
You also need to have three text files, called `long.txt`, `med.txt`, and `short.txt`
in that directory. You can use the files from this repository or substitute with your own.
The `long.txt` file will be used as the pool for easy mode, `med.txt` for medium, and
`short.txt` for hard.

Words lists come from [this repository](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english)
